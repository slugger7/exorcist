# Exorcist

This project is a linking or a workflow project for the the exorcist project.

In the [gitignore](./.gitignore) you will see that there are two folders that have been ignored `web` and `server`.
The idea being that you can pull [exorcist-server](https://github.com/slugger7/exorcist-server) into the [server](./server) and the [exorcist-web](https://github.com/slugger7/exorcist-web) into the [web](./web) folder

In VS code you can then manage all three projects git individually but have common things living in this repository like [vscode folder](./.vscode)
